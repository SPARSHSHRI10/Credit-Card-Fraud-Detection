# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
Detecting fraud transactions has become the need of the hour. Fraudulent transactions are increasing at an alarming rate. Financial losses due to fraud have a serious negative impact on merchants, banks, and individual customers. Billions of dollars have been lost in recent years due to the unlawful activities of credit card fraudsters.

# Our Work
In this project we have built a 4 layered deep neural network in order to classify the transaction as fraudulent or not. 

Dataset can be downloaded from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud

We see that credit card fraud detection does not give appropriate results due to heavy class imbalance. Therefore we try using undersampling and oversampling techniques to deal with the imbalance dataset and try to find performance metrics of the model.
